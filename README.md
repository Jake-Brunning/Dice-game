# Dice-game
Simple c# dice game with external saving of usernames, passwords and top scores.
Yeah I made this as the start of Y11 (the majority of my class had to do a dice game in vb for an NEA). I remember it meant to be taking 20 hours which it didn't so I spent most
of my time helping the rest of the class. Just decided it could be a good test of my basic understanding to make it. Time spent on project: 3 Hours.
